Delete this repository after our tutor session

Hi Luis, once I have added this file to git tracking, then committed the changes, and then pushed to GitHub, this local repository and the remote GItHub repository will be up to date with each other.

The 3 steps for saving work locally to GitHub are:

1. git add . > stage your files for committing
2. git commit -m "your message goes here" > commit your changes
3. git push origin main > push your changes fromm local to remote
